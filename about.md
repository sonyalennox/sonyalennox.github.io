I have a diploma in Graphic Communications and Print Technology from SAIT. I decided to further pursue my interest in Web Development by going into the fast-track Web Development program offered at SAIT. I joined the Web Developer program to help bring clients ideas from just being on paper to having a physical website that everyone sees. I enjoys working with clients, alongside fellow employees as well as meeting new people in the industry. I have experience working with Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Adobe Acrobat. I am knowledgeable in HTML, CSS, and has learned JavaScript in class. I has effective time and file management skills which helps to make her a dependable employee in the workplace. I look forward to continuing learning and building my skills further throughout her career.
